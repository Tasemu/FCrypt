  "body": "# FCrypt Browser Extension\r\n\r\nFCrypt is a browser extension that allows for end to end encrypted chat through the facebook.com chat application. Currently the plugin pnly supports facebook.com and not messenger.com, and only supports chrome. Support for more browsers will be added soon and hopefully support for messenger as well.\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\nThese instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.\r\n\r\n### Install Packaged Extension file\r\n\r\nA testing file as a packaged chrome extension file (.crx) can be downloaded from the releases section of this repo and installed into chrome by dragging the .crx file into the chrome extensions settings panel.\r\n\r\n### Prerequisities\r\n\r\nTo get the development version of the extension up and running you will need to clone this repo and install the dependencies by running npm install.\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/Tasemu/FCrypt.git\r\ncd FCrypt\r\nnpm install\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo compile the source you need to run webpack. This will create the files required to run the extension within the /dist/ directory. --watch can be added optionally to watch the files for any changes and recompile automatically.\r\n\r\n```\r\nwebpack --watch\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Installing\r\n\r\nOnce all Prerequisities are installed, the unpackaged version of the extension can be installed into chrome by opening the extensions settings panel in chrome and selecting the 'developer mode' checkbox. From here you can select to load an unpackaged extension and point it to the /dist/ directory.\r\n\r\n## Deployment\r\n\r\nYou can generate a new packaged .crx file by going to the chrome extensions settings panel and selecting 'package extension', then pointing the packager to the /dist/ directory.\r\n\r\n## Built With\r\n\r\n* NPM\r\n* FontAwesome\r\n* Remodal V1\r\n* Bililite.js\r\n* jQuery\r\n\r\n\r\n## Versioning\r\n\r\nWe use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning.
